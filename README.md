# Katas Practice Repository

Welcome to the **Katas Practice Repository**! This project is a personal space where I tackle programming katas to sharpen my skills, explore new techniques, and practice problem-solving. Each kata is an independent exercise with its own solution and explanation.

## About

Programming katas are exercises designed to improve coding skills through repetition and experimentation. This repository will feature katas from various sources and challenges across different domains such as algorithms, data structures, and more.

Whether youâ€™re here to review the solutions, suggest improvements, or practice along, youâ€™re welcome to explore!

## Technologies Used

The repository is designed to be flexible and may include katas implemented in multiple languages, such as:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (e.g., Node.js environment)
- **Java**
- **React**
- Others as I explore additional languages

Each kata is placed in its respective language folder.
Inside each kata directory, you'll find:

- Code source: Contains the implementation.
- README.md: Provides the problem description, thought process, and notes.
